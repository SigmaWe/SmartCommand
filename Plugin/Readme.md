Folliwing the official vscode extension tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)
Make sure you have Node.js and Git installed, then install Yeoman and VS Code Extension Generator with:

`npm install -g yo generator-code`

Then download the folder Plugin as zip from (git repo)[https://github.com/SigmaWe/text2command/tree/main/Plugin] and unzip it.

## Run the plugin locally

Open the folder Plugin/text2command in VSCode locally. Use F5 to run the plugin and it will open a new VSCode window. Open command palette in that new VSCode window and search NLPSearch command. Check the plugin Readme file for extension usage guides.

### Notice

If it shows error after press F5 to run the plugin, one can choose debug anyway to temporaily ignore it and continue.
