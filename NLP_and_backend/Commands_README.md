# List of All Command Files

## command_title_list.json
Contains a list of all commands and their corresponding titles (if they have one) found in the Default Keybindings JSON file generated by a clean slate VSCode with no extensions installed by the user. The file contains of the built in core, and built in extension commands. While the command IDs were present in the keybindings file, the command titles were obtained using the `get_commands_using_gui.py` script. To create the `command_title_list.json` file, follow the steps below. 
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Press Ctrl-Shift-P and select "Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
3. Copy the JSON list from the file and paste it into `default_keybindings.json`
4. Copy the series of comments under the JSON list and paste it into `default_commands_not_bound.txt` (make sure to add a newline at the end of the file by pressing Enter)
5. Open the `get_command_using_gui.py` script and find the comment that tells you to copy the test string
6. Press Ctrl-Shift-P again and select "Open Keyboard Shortcuts"
7. Open a Terminal within the VSCode editor and run the `get_commands_using_gui.py` script.

## plugInCommandsOutput.json
Contains a list of all VSCode extension commands installed on the system. This only includes plug in commands from plug ins that were installed by the user, from the Marketplace. This file was obtained by running `PlugInCommands.py`.
